## 0.6.1

**Security fix — upgrade recommended.** Completes 0.6.0's "refuse an invoice whose amount can't be positively bounded" guarantee by closing two remaining ways an unbounded or ambiguous invoice could still be paid:

- **Literal-zero invoices.** A BOLT11 invoice encoding a literal `0` amount (e.g. `lnbc0p1...`) decoded to `0`, which slipped past the "no amount" check, passed the budget check, and reached the wallet as an effectively-amountless invoice (the wallet then chooses the actual spend). The resolved amount must now be **strictly positive from every source** (BOLT11 decode and MPP fallback); `0` or negative is refused.
- **Decoder amount injection (HRP-anchoring).** The amount regex was terminated by the first `1`, so a crafted invoice could smuggle digits from the bech32 data part and decode to a bogus positive that passed the budget check with a fabricated number. The amount is now read **only from the human-readable part** (isolated at the true last-`1` separator), so data-part digits can't influence it.

## 0.6.0

**Security fix — upgrade recommended.** An invoice whose amount could not be read was treated as "no amount to check" and paid anyway, skipping `budget.check()` altogether. That went well beyond the sats limits:

- **The domain allowlist was bypassed.** `allowedDomains` is enforced inside the same `check()` call the missing amount skipped, so an amountless invoice was paid from *any* domain, allowlisted or not.
- **The spend was never recorded.** It never reached the `SpendingLog`, so it stayed out of every later budget check and out of any audit of what the client had already spent — you cannot reconstruct that exposure from the log after the fact.

A server that wanted a blank cheque only had to send an invoice with no amount.

**Breaking:** invoices with no readable amount now throw `InvoiceAmountUnknownError` instead of being paid. If you relied on paying amountless invoices, this release stops that.
